## What you should know before you begin {-}

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
A list is a _recursive vector_: a vector that can contain another vector or list in each of its elements. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Lists are one of the most flexible data structures in R. As a result, they are used as a general purpose glue to hold objects together. You will find lists disguised as model objects, data frames, list-columns within data frames, and more.
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Data frames are a sub-type of list. Each column of a data frame is an element of the list that the data frame is built around.
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
More than any other part of R, lists demonstrate how a programming language can appear different to beginners than to experts. Seasoned R programmers do not distinguish between lists and vectors because the two are equivalent: a list is a type of vector. Many, perhaps all, of the recipes in this chapter will also work with other types of vectors.

However, a beginner who uses R for data science will quickly appreciate that lists behave differently than other types of vectors. Users will encounter two main differences. First, many R functions will not accept lists as input, but will accept other types of vectors. Second, when you subset a list with `[ ]` to extract the value of one of its elements, R will give you a new list of length one that contains the value. This poses a problem if you want to pass that value to a function that does not accept lists as input.

Since this book is written for beginners and practitioners, I've treated lists as a distinct type of object. This introduces a new problem: when you speak about R, it is difficult to distinguish between vectors that are lists and vectors that are not lists.  Whenever the difference matters, I'll call the first set of vectors **lists** and the second set of vectors **data vectors**. This chapter focuses on lists.

## Extract an element from a list 

You want to return an element of a list as it is, perhaps to use in a function. You do not want the element to come embedded in a list of length one.

#### Solution {-}

```{r}
# returns the element named x in state.center
state.center %>% 
  pluck("x")
```

#### Discussion {-}

`pluck()` comes in the purrr package and does the equivalent of `[[` subsetting. If you pass `pluck()` a character string, `pluck()` will return the element whose name matches the string. If you pass `pluck()` an integer _n_, `pluck()` will return the _nth_ element.

Pass multiple arguments to `pluck()` to subset multiple times. `pluck()` will subset the result of each argument with the argument that follows, e.g.

```{r}
library(repurrrsive)
sw_films %>% 
  pluck(7, "title")
```

## Apply a function iteratively to each element of a list

You want to apply a function separately to each element in a list and then combine the results into a single object. This is similar to what you might do with a for loop, or with the apply family of functions.

For example, `got_chars` is a list of 30 sublists. Each of the 30 sublists contains information about a different character in the _Game of Thrones_ television series. One piece of information contained in each sublist is the character's name.

You would like to return just the names of each character in `got_chars`. To do this, you will apply `pluck()` separately to each sublist to retrieve the names. Then you will combine the results into a new list.

#### Solution {-}

```{r, output_max_height = "300px"}
library(repurrrsive)
got_chars %>% 
  map(pluck, "name")
```

#### Discussion {-}

`map()` takes a vector to iterate over (here supplied by the pipe) followed by a function to apply to each element of the vector, followed by any arguments to pass to the function when it is applied to the vector. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/purrr-map.png")
```


Pass the function name to `map()` without quotes and without parentheses. `map()` will pass each element of the vector one at a time to the first argument of the function. 

If your function requires additional arguments to do its job, pass the arguments to `map()`. `map()` will forward these arguments in order, with their names, to the function when `map()` runs the function.

##### The map family of functions

`map()` is one of 10 similar functions provided by the purrr package. Together these functions form a family. Each function in the family applies a function to a vector in the same iterative way. However, each function in the family returns the results in a different type of data structure. For example, `map()` returns the results in a list, as above. `map_chr()` returns the results as a character vector:

```{r}
got_chars %>% 
  map_chr(pluck, "name")
```

Function  | Returns
--------- | ---------
`map`     | A list
`map_chr` | A character vector
`map_dbl` | A double (numeric) vector
`map_df`  | A data frame (`map_df` does the equivalent of `map_dfr`)
`map_dfr` | A single data frame made by row-binding the individual results^[These results should themselves be data frames. In other words, the function that is mapped should return a data frame.]
`map_dfc` | A single data frame made by column-binding the individual results^[These results should themselves be data frames. In other words, the function that is mapped should return a data frame.]
`map_int` | An integer vector
`map_lgl` | A logical vector
`walk`    | The original input (returned invisibly)

#### How to choose a map function

To map a function over a vector, consider what type of output the function will produce. Then pick the map function that will combine that type of data into a single structure in a useful way. 

For example, suppose you want to map the function `length()` which returns an integer, over `got_chars`.

`map_int()` would return the results as an integer vector. This is useful because it does not modify the type of the results.

```{r}
got_chars %>% 
  map_int(length)
```

In contrast, `map_chr()` will return the results as a character vector, coercing their type to character as it does. This is less useful; you cannot do math with this output.

```{r}
got_chars %>% 
  map_chr(length)
```

`walk()` is intended to be used with a function like `plot()` or `print()`. These functions use their input to generate a side effect, but they do not themselves return an object to pass on.

##### How to map over the 2nd, 3rd, or nth argument of a function

Every function in the map family recognizes a shortcut syntax built around the `~` symbol and the pronoun `.x` (or alternatively `.`).

To use the syntax, pass an expression that contains a `.x` and is preceeded by a `~` to a map function. The map function will pass to `.x` the elements of the vector to iterate over.

You can use this syntax to map to an argument that is not the first,

```{r eval = FALSE}
gap_split %>% 
  map(~lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = .x))
```

You can also use this syntax to map an arbitrary expression over a vector,

```{r eval = FALSE}
got_chars %>% 
  map_lgl(~length(.x) > 0)
```
