## What you should know before you begin {-}

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
A list is a _recursive vector_: a vector that can contain another vector or list in each of its elements. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
When you speak about R, it is difficult to distinguish between vectors that are lists and vectors that are not lists.  Whenever the difference matters, I'll call the first set of vectors **lists** and the second set of vectors **data vectors**. This chapter focuses on lists.
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Lists are one of the most flexible data structures in R. As a result, they are used as a general purpose glue to hold objects together. You will find lists disguised as model objects, data frames, list-columns within data frames, and more.
```

```{block2, type='rmdcaution'}
Data frames are a sub-type of list. Each column of a data frame is an element of the list that the data frame is built around.
```
