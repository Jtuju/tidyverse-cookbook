["index.html", "The Tidyverse Cookbook Welcome How the recipes are organized How to get help Legal disclaimer", " The Tidyverse Cookbook Edited by Garrett Grolemund 2018-11-30 Welcome This book is an R community project, and it wouldn’t be nearly as good without your help. There are a number of ways you can contribute, from spotting typos to adding recipes. Read How to Contribute to get started. This book collects code recipes for doing data science with R’s tidyverse. Each recipe solves a single common task, with a minimum of discussion. Everything in this book is licensed under the permissive Creative Commons 4.0 International License. We encourage you to reuse and adapt the recipes. How the recipes are organized The recipes in this book are organized according to the model of data science presented in R for Data Science. When you do data science, you find yourself repeating the same sequence of steps: I’ve grouped the recipes by task with the exception of Transform, which is split into chapters based on the type of data or structure to transform. To drill down to a recipe, click on one of the task names in the sidebar. If you are new to R, begin with Program, which will show you how to install the tidyverse. To save space, each recipe assumes that you have already run library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;). If additional library() calls are required, they will appear in the recipe. How to get help R comes with a built in reference manual, which is fondly (but inaccurately) called R’s help pages. You can use R’s help pages to glean details that I do not cover here. To access the help page for an R function, type a ? at the command line followed by the function name, and then run the result, e.g. ?mutate If a function comes in an R package, you will need to load the package with library() before you access the function’s help page. Alternatively, you can access the help page by typing a ? followed by the package name, followed by ::, followed by the function name, e.g. ?dplyr::mutate Legal disclaimer I believe that each recipe in this book works as advertised, but be aware that the recipes come with the same warranty as R: ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

You can begin a recipe by copying and pasting the following template: ## TITLE You want to #### Solution {-} #### Discussion {-} Keep in mind that your solution code must run. When you write the recipe, assume that the user has run library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) and nothing else. Where possible, try to minimize additional package dependencies. A useful way to do this is to use data that comes in a tidyverse package. Here are the tidyverse data sets and the packages you’ll find them in. # data frames (tibbles) dplyr::band_instruments dplyr::band_instruments2 dplyr::band_members dplyr::starwars dplyr::storms forcats::gss_cat ggplot2::diamonds ggplot2::economics ggplot2::economics_long ggplot2::faithfuld ggplot2::midwest ggplot2::mpg ggplot2::msleep ggplot2::presidential ggplot2::seals ggplot2::txhousing modelr::heights modelr::sim1 modelr::sim2 modelr::sim3 modelr::sim4 tidyr::population tidyr::smiths tidyr::table1 tidyr::table2 tidyr::table3 tidyr::table4a tidyr::table4b tidyr::table5 tidyr::who # data frames (non-tibbles) ggplot2::luv_colours lubridate::lakers # arrays dplyr::nasa # character vectors stringr::fruit stringr::sentences stringr::words "],
["what-is-the-tidyverse.html", "What is the tidyverse?", " What is the tidyverse? Each of the recipes in this book relies on R’s tidyverse, which is a collection of packages, functions, and ideas. You do not need to know which ideas are in the tidyverse to use tidyverse functions, just as you do not need to know which ingredients are in a cake mix to make a cake. But understanding the tidyverse will help you see the best practices embedded in each recipe. This will make it easier for you to adapt the recipes to your own work. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science. Tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, so when you learn how to use one tidyverse package, you learn a lot about how to use the others. Tidyverse packages are also: optimised to run fast, relying on C++ under the hood maintained by a paid staff of talented developers unusually well documented, see tidyverse.org and R for Data Science as examples. Install the complete set of tidyverse packages with: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) 0.0.1 Tidy data Each package in the tidyverse is designed to use and return tidy data whenever appropriate. Tidy data is tabular data organized so that: Each column contains a single variable Each row contains a single observation In practice, tidy data in R appears as data frames or tibbles. A tibble is an enhanced version of a data frame that is easier to view at the command line. R treats tibbles like data frames in almost every other respect, because tibbles are a subclass of data frame. Tidy tibbles act as a common data structure that tidyverse functions use to talk to each other. Tidy data has other advantages as well. Tidy data aligns with R’s native data structure, the data frame; and tidy data is easy to use with R’s fast, built in vectorized operations. You can think of tidy data as the data format optimized for R. 0.0.2 Tidy tools Each package in the tidyverse also provides tidy tools. Tidy tools are R functions that: Accept and return the same type of data structure (as input and output) Focus on one task per function Can be combined with other functions to perform multi-step operations (using the pipe operator, %&gt;%) Tidy tools ensure that tidyverse packages are easy for you to use. If tidy data is the data format optimised for R, tidy tools are the function format optimised for R users. If you’d like to develop a deeper understanding of the tidyverse, I encourage you to read R for Data Science, or to work through the free tutorials on RStudio Cloud. "],

Install a tidyverse package Install all of the tidyverse packages Load a single tidyverse package Load the core set of tidyverse packages Update a tidyverse package Check that all of your tidyverse packages are up-to-date List every package in the tidyverse Combine functions into a pipe Pipe a result to a specific argument What you should know before you begin An R package is a bundle of functions, documentation, and data sets. R has over 13,000 packages. These are not installed with R, but are archived online for when you need them. The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that are designed to work well together. There are about 25 packages in the tidyverse. To use an R package, you must: Install the package on your local machine with install.packages(). You only need to do this once per machine. Load the package with library(). You need to do this each time you start a new R session (if you wish to use the package in that session). You cannot use the contents of a package until you load the package in your current R session. You should update your packages from time to time to receive the latest improvements from package authors. Tidyverse functions are designed to be used with the %&gt;% operator. %&gt;% links R functions together to create a “pipe” of functions that are run in sequence: %&gt;% passes the output of one function to the input of the next. %&gt;% comes with the dplyr package, which imports it from the magrittr package. 1.1 Install a tidyverse package You’d like to install a package that is in the tidyverse. Solution install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Discussion Tidyverse packages can be installed in the normal way with install.packages(). See ?install.packages for installation details. By default, install.packages() will download packages from https://cran.r-project.org, or one of its mirrors—so be sure you are connected to the internet when you run it. 1.2 Install all of the tidyverse packages You’d like to install all of the packages in the tidyverse with a single command. Solution install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Discussion The tidyverse package provides a shortcut for downloading all of the packages in the tidyverse. tidyverse purposefully lists each of the tidyverse packages as a dependency, which causes R to install all of the packages in the tidyverse when R installs tidyverse. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) will install the following packages: ## [1] &quot;broom&quot; &quot;cli&quot; &quot;crayon&quot; &quot;dplyr&quot; &quot;dbplyr&quot; ## [6] &quot;forcats&quot; &quot;ggplot2&quot; &quot;haven&quot; &quot;hms&quot; &quot;httr&quot; ## [11] &quot;jsonlite&quot; &quot;lubridate&quot; &quot;magrittr&quot; &quot;modelr&quot; &quot;purrr&quot; ## [16] &quot;readr&quot; &quot;readxl\\n(&gt;=&quot; &quot;reprex&quot; &quot;rlang&quot; &quot;rstudioapi&quot; ## [21] &quot;rvest&quot; &quot;stringr&quot; &quot;tibble&quot; &quot;tidyr&quot; &quot;xml2&quot; ## [26] &quot;tidyverse&quot; 1.3 Load a single tidyverse package You want to load a package in the tidyverse that has been installed on your computer, so that you can use its contents. Solution library(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Discussion You can load individual tidyverse packages with library(). The package will stay loaded until you end your R session or run detach() on the package. If you begin a new R session, you will need to reload the package in the new session with library(). library() cannot load packages that have not been previously installed on your machine. 1.4 Load the core set of tidyverse packages You would like to load the most used tidyverse packages so you can use their contents. You’ve already installed these packages on your computer. Solution library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Discussion When you load the tidyverse package, R will also load the following packages: ggplot2 dplyr tidyr readr purrr tibble stringr forcats These eight packages are considered the “core” of the tidyverse because: They are the most used tidyverse packages. They are often used together as a set (when you use one of the packages, you tend to also use the others). You can still load each of these packages individually with library(). Notice that library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) does not load every package installed by install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;). You must use library() to individually load the “non-core” tidyverse packages. 1.5 Update a tidyverse package You want to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of a package in the tidyverse installed on your machine. Solution update.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) Discussion update.packages() will compare the version number of the package that you have installed locally to the newest version number available on CRAN. If the version numbers do not match, update.packages() will download and install the newest version from CRAN. Be sure that you are connected to the internet when you run update.packages(). 1.6 Check that all of your tidyverse packages are up-to-date You want to ensure that you have the latest version of every tidyverse package. Solution tidyverse_update() Discussion tidyverse_update() checks whether or not each of your tidyverse packages is up-to-date. If every package is up-to-date, tidyverse_update() will return the message: All tidyverse packages up-to-date. Otherwise, tidyverse_update() will return a piece of code that you can copy and run to selectively update only those packages that are out-of-date. 1.7 List every package in the tidyverse You want to generate a vector that contains the names of every package in the tidyverse. Solution tidyverse_packages() ## [1] &quot;broom&quot; &quot;cli&quot; &quot;crayon&quot; &quot;dplyr&quot; &quot;dbplyr&quot; ## [6] &quot;forcats&quot; &quot;ggplot2&quot; &quot;haven&quot; &quot;hms&quot; &quot;httr&quot; ## [11] &quot;jsonlite&quot; &quot;lubridate&quot; &quot;magrittr&quot; &quot;modelr&quot; &quot;purrr&quot; ## [16] &quot;readr&quot; &quot;readxl\\n(&gt;=&quot; &quot;reprex&quot; &quot;rlang&quot; &quot;rstudioapi&quot; ## [21] &quot;rvest&quot; &quot;stringr&quot; &quot;tibble&quot; &quot;tidyr&quot; &quot;xml2&quot; ## [26] &quot;tidyverse&quot; Discussion tidyverse_packages() returns a vector with the names of every package that was in the tidyverse when you installed the tidyverse package. These are the packages that were installed onto your machine along with the tidyverse package. They are also the packages that tidyverse_update() will check. Update the tidyverse package before running tidyverse_packages() to receive the most current list. 1.8 Combine functions into a pipe You want to chain multiple functions together to be run in sequence, with each function operating on the preceeding function’s output. Solution starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% arrange(avg_height) ## # A tibble: 38 x 2 ## species avg_height ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Yoda&#39;s species 66 ## 2 Aleena 79 ## 3 Ewok 88 ## 4 Vulptereen 94 ## 5 Dug 112 ## 6 Xexto 122 ## 7 Toydarian 137 ## 8 Droid 140 ## 9 Sullustan 160 ## 10 &lt;NA&gt; 160 ## # ... with 28 more rows Discussion The %&gt;% operator (pronounced “pipe operator”) evaluates the code on its left hand side (LHS) and then passes the result to the the code on its right hand side (RHS), which should be a function call. By default %&gt;% will pass the result of the LHS to the first unnamed argument of the function on the RHS. starwars %&gt;% group_by(species) is the equivalent of group_by(starwars, species), and the above solution is the equivalent of the nested code: arrange( summarise( group_by(starwars, species), avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE) ), avg_height ) or the equivalent of: x1 &lt;- starwars x2 &lt;- group_by(x1, species) x3 &lt;- summarise(x3, avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) arrange(x3, avg_height) The chunk of functions connected by %&gt;% is called a “pipe.” Pipes are easier to read than nested code (mentally pronounce %&gt;% as “then” to read the pipe as a sequence of steps). And pipes require fewer temporary objects than code that passes temporary objects from one function to the next. The %&gt;% operator is loaded with the dplyr package, which imports it from the magrittr package. Tidyverse functions facilitate using %&gt;% by accepting a data frame as their first argument returning a data frame as their result %&gt;% is easy to type in the RStudio IDE with the keyboard shortcuts Command + Shift + M (Mac OS) Control + Shift + M (Windows) 1.9 Pipe a result to a specific argument You want to use %&gt;% to pass the result of the left hand side to an argument that is not the first argument of the function on the right hand side. Solution starwars %&gt;% lm(mass ~ height, data = .) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = mass ~ height, data = .) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) height ## -13.8103 0.6386 Discussion By default %&gt;% passes the result of the left hand side to the the first unnamed argument of the function on the right hand side. To override this default, use . as a placeholder within the function call on the right hand side. %&gt;% will evaluate . as the result of the left hand side, instead of passing the result to the first unnamed argument. The solution code is the equivalent of lm(mass ~ height, data = starwars) "],
["import.html", "2 Import What you should know before you begin 2.1 Import data quickly with a GUI", " 2 Import Import data quickly with a GUI What you should know before you begin Before you can manipulate data with R, you need to import the data into R’s memory, or build a connection that R can use to access the data remotely. How you import data will depend on the format in which the data is stored. The most common way to store small data sets is as a plain text file. Data may also be stored in a proprietary format associated with a specific piece of software, such as SAS, SPSS, or Microsoft Excel. Data collected from the internet is often stored as a JSON file. Large data sets may be stored in a database or a distributed storage system. R stores data in your computer’s RAM while you manipulate it. This creates a size limitation: truly big data sets should be stored outside of R in a database or distributed storage system that R can connect to to manipulate the data. 2.1 Import data quickly with a GUI You want to import data quickly, and you do not mind using a semi-reproducible graphical user interface (GUI) to do so. Solution Discussion The RStudio IDE provides an Import Dataset button in the Environment pane, which appears in the top right corner of the IDE by default. You can use this button to import data that is stored in plain text files as well as in Excel, SAS, SPSS, and Stata files. Click the button to launch a window that includes a file browser (below). Use the browser to select the file to import. After you’ve selected a file, RStudio will display a preview of how the file will be imported as a data frame. Below the preview, RStudio provides a GUI interface to the common options for importing the type of file you have selected. As you customize the options, RStudio updates the data preview to display the results. The bottom right-hand corner of the window displays the code that will reproduce your importation process programatically. You should copy and save this code if you wish to document your work in a reproducible workflow. "],

Data tidying is an important first step for your analysis because every tidyverse function will expect your data to be stored as Tidy Data. Tidy data is tabular data organized so that: Each column contains a single variable Each row contains a single observation The definition of tidy data depends on the definition of variable, which is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. With enough mental flexibility, you can consider anything to be a variable (and use anything as a variable). However, some variables will be more useful than others for any specific task. In general, if you can formulate your task as an equation (math or code that contains an equals sign), the most useful variables will be the objects in the equation. Tidy data is not an arbitrary requirement of the tidyverse; it is the ideal data format for doing data science with R. Tidy data makes it easy to extract every value of a variable to build a plot or to compute a summary statistic. Tidy data also makes it easy to compute new variables; when your data is tidy, you can rely on R’s rowwise operations to maintain the integrity of your observations. Moreover, R can directly manipulate tidy data with R’s fast, built-in vectorised observations, which lets your code run as fast as possible. 3.1 Create a tibble manually You want to create a tibble from scratch by typing in the contents of the tibble. Solution tribble(~number, ~letter, ~greek, 1, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;alpha&quot;, 2, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, 3, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;) ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## number letter greek ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 a alpha ## 2 2 b beta ## 3 3 c gamma Discussion tribble() creates a tibble while generating a preview of the result in your code. To use tribble(), list each column name preceded by a ~, then list the values of the tribble in a rowwise fashion. If you take care to align your columns, the transposed syntax of tribble() becomes a preview of the table. You can also create a tibble with tibble(), whose syntax mirrors data.frame(): tibble(number = c(1, 2, 3), letter = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;), greek = c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;gamma&quot;)) 3.2 Convert a data frame to a tibble You want to convert a data frame to a tibble.

This includes: the dimensions of the tibble the column names and types as many cells of the tibble as will fit comfortably in your console window 3.5 Inspect every cell of a tibble You want to see which values are stored in a tibble. Solution View(storms) Discussion View() (with a capital V) opens the tibble in R’s data viewer, which will let you scroll to every cell in the tibble. 3.6 Spread a pair of columns into a field of cells You want to pivot, convert long data to wide, or move variable names out of the cells and into the column names. These are different ways of describing the same thing. For example, table2 contains type, which is a column that repeats the variable names case and population. To make table2 tidy, you must move case and population values into their own columns. table2 ## # A tibble: 12 x 4 ## country year type count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 cases 745 ## 2 Afghanistan 1999 population 19987071 ## 3 Afghanistan 2000 cases 2666 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 population 20595360 ## 5 Brazil 1999 cases 37737 ## 6 Brazil 1999 population 172006362 ## 7 Brazil 2000 cases 80488 ## 8 Brazil 2000 population 174504898 ## 9 China 1999 cases 212258 ## 10 China 1999 population 1272915272 ## 11 China 2000 cases 213766 ## 12 China 2000 population 1280428583 Solution table2 %&gt;% spread(key = type, value = count) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 Discussion To use spread(), assign the column that contains variable names to key. Assign the column that contains the values that are associated with those names to value. spread() will: Make a copy of the original table Remove the key and value columns from the copy Remove every duplicate row in the data set that remains Insert a new column for each unique variable name in the key column Fill the new columns with the values of the value column in a way that preserves each relationship between values in the original data set Each new column created by spread() will inherit the data type of the value column. If you would like spread() to convert each new column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument convert = TRUE. 3.7 Gather a field of cells into a pair of columns You want to convert wide data to long, reshape a two-by-two table, or move variable values out of the column names and into the cells. These are different ways of describing the same thing. For example, table4a is a two-by-two table with the column names 1999 and 2000. These names are values of a year variable. The field of cells in table4a contains counts of TB cases, which is another variable. To make table4a tidy, you need to move year and cases into their own columns. table4a ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## country `1999` `2000` ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 745 2666 ## 2 Brazil 37737 80488 ## 3 China 212258 213766 Solution table4a %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;cases&quot;, 2:3) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year cases ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 ## 2 Brazil 1999 37737 ## 3 China 1999 212258 ## 4 Afghanistan 2000 2666 ## 5 Brazil 2000 80488 ## 6 China 2000 213766 Discussion gather() is the inverse of spread(): gather() collapses a field of cells that spans several columns into two columns: A column of former “keys”, which contains the column names of the former field A column of former “values”, which contains the cell values of the former field To use gather(), pick names for the new key and value columns, and supply them as strings. Then identify the columns to gather into the new key and value columns. gather() will: Create a copy of the original table Remove the identified columns from the copy Add a key column with the supplied name Fill the key column with the column names of the removed columns, repeating rows as necessary so that each combination of row and removed column name appears once Add a value column with the supplied name Fill the value column with the values of the removed columns in a way that preserves each relationship between values and column names in the original data set You can identify the columns to remove by name, by index (number), by inverse index (negative number), or by any of the select() helpers, which come in the dplyr package. So for example, the following commands will do the same thing as the solution above: table4a %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;cases&quot;, `&quot;1999&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;) table4a %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;cases&quot;, -1) table4a %&gt;% gather(key = &quot;year&quot;, value = &quot;cases&quot;, one_of(c(&quot;1999&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;))) By default, the new key column will contain character strings. If you would like gather() to convert the new key column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument convert = TRUE. 3.8 Separate a column into new columns You want to split a single column into multiple columns by separating each cell in the column into a row of cells that each contain a separate portion of the value in the original cell. For example, table3 combines cases and population values in a single column named rate. To make table3 tidy, you need to separate rate into two columns: one for the cases variable, one for the population variable. table3 ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year rate ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 Solution table3 %&gt;% separate(col = rate, into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;), sep = &quot;/&quot;, convert = TRUE) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country year cases population ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745 19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666 20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737 172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488 174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258 1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766 1280428583 Discussion To use separate(), pass col the name of the column to split. Pass into a vector of names for the new columns that col will be split into. You should supply one name for each new column that you expect to appear in the result; a mismatch will imply that something went wrong. separate() will: Create a copy of the original data set Add a new column for each name in into Split each value of col into multiple values. To do this, separate() will locate the positions of a separator character in each value. separate() will then makes the segments that appear between the separators separate (sub)values. Place the resulting (sub)values into the new columns in order, one (sub)value per column Remove the col column Add the argument remove = FALSE to retain the col column in the final result. By default, separate() will use each non-alpha-numeric character as a separator. To designate a specific separator character, pass a regular expression to sep. To split values into sequences that each have a specific number of characters, pass an integer vector to sep: sep = 1 will split each value between the first and second character. sep = c(1, 3) will split each value between the first and second character and then again between the third and fourth character. sep = -1 will split each value between the last and second to last character. Each new column created by separate() will inherit the data type of the col column. If you would like separate() to convert each new column to the most sensible data type given its final contents, add the argument convert = TRUE. 3.9 Unite multiple columns into a single column You want to combine several columns into a single column by uniting their values across rows. For example, table5 splits the year variable across two columns: century and year. To make table5 tidy, you need to unite century and year into a single column. table5 ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## country century year rate ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 19 99 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 20 00 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 19 99 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 20 00 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 19 99 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 20 00 213766/1280428583 Solution table5 %&gt;% unite(col = &quot;year&quot;, century, year, sep = &quot;&quot;) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## country year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan 1999 745/19987071 ## 2 Afghanistan 2000 2666/20595360 ## 3 Brazil 1999 37737/172006362 ## 4 Brazil 2000 80488/174504898 ## 5 China 1999 212258/1272915272 ## 6 China 2000 213766/1280428583 Discussion To use unite(), give col a character string to use as the name of the new column to create. Then list the columns to combine, and give sep a separator character to use to paste together the values in the cells of each column. unite() will: Paste together the values of the listed columns in vectorized (i.e. rowwise) fashion. unite() will place sep between each value during the paste process. Append the result as a column named col to a copy of the original data set Remove the listed columns. To retain the columns in the result, add the argument remove = FALSE. If you do not suppy a sep value, unite() will use _ as a separator character. "],

You can also pluck a column by integer position: table1 %&gt;% pluck(3) ## [1] 745 2666 37737 80488 212258 213766 4.14 Summarise data You want to Solution Discussion 4.15 Summarise data by groups You want to Solution Discussion 4.16 Mutate data You want to Solution Discussion Transforming a table sometimes requires more than one recipe. Why? Because tables are made of multiple data structures that work together: The table itself is a data frame or tibble. The columns of the table are vectors. Some columns may be list-columns, which are lists that contain vectors. This matters because one of the design philosophies of the tidyverse is that each function should focus on one task and do it well. Functions that do one task well tend to work with one type of data structure. So to transform a table, you often need to combine a function that manipulates tables with a function that manipulates data vectors and maybe a function that manipulates lists. In R, it is difficult to distinguish between vectors that are lists and vectors that are not lists. Whenever the difference matters, I’ll call the first set of vectors lists and the second set data vectors. This seems sensible because non-list vectors are used to store data: every piece of data is stored in one. In turn, a data vector may be stored in a list or a data frame. Data vectors include atomic vectors but also include modified atomic vectors like factors and date-times. 4.17 How to combine transform recipes There are two ways to When you transform a data frame, you often work with several functions: A function that transforms the structure of the data frame to add or remove rows or columns. This function transforms a table. A function that transforms the values that appear in the data frame to create new values to place in a new row or column. This function transforms a data vector. A function that mediates between 1 and 2 if the values are embedded in a list-column, which is a list. The most concise way to learn how to combine these functions is to learn about the functions in isolation, and to then have the functions call each other as necessary. 4.17.1 An Example mtcars contains performance data for 32 cars.1 mtcars ## # A tibble: 32 x 5 ## mpg cyl disp hp drat ## * &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 21 6 160 110 3.9 ## 2 21 6 160 110 3.9 ## 3 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 ## 4 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 ## 5 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 ## 6 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 ## 7 14.3 8 360 245 3.21 ## 8 24.4 4 147. 62 3.69 ## 9 22.8 4 141. 95 3.92 ## 10 19.2 6 168. 123 3.92 ## # ... with 22 more rows To round the mpg value for each car, you would need two functions: round() which can round the values of the data vector stored in mtcars$mpg.2 round(mtcars$mpg) ## [1] 21 21 23 21 19 18 14 24 23 19 18 16 17 15 10 10 15 32 30 34 22 16 15 ## [24] 13 19 27 26 30 16 20 15 21 mutate() which can add the results to a copy of the mtcars table. mtcars %&gt;% mutate(mpg_int = round(mpg)) ## # A tibble: 32 x 6 ## mpg cyl disp hp drat mpg_int ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 21 6 160 110 3.9 21 ## 2 21 6 160 110 3.9 21 ## 3 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 23 ## 4 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 21 ## 5 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 19 ## 6 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 18 ## 7 14.3 8 360 245 3.21 14 ## 8 24.4 4 147. 62 3.69 24 ## 9 22.8 4 141. 95 3.92 23 ## 10 19.2 6 168. 123 3.92 19 ## # ... with 22 more rows round() works with data vectors. mutate() works with tables. Together they create the table you want. 4.17.2 Another Example sepals contains sepal length measurements for three species of flower. The measurements are stored in a list-column named lengths.3 sepals ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## Species lengths ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 setosa &lt;dbl [50]&gt; ## 2 versicolor &lt;dbl [50]&gt; ## 3 virginica &lt;dbl [50]&gt; Each cell in lengths contains a data vector of 50 sepal lengths. # For example, the first cell of lengths sepals[[1, 2]] ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 ## [18] 5.1 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 ## [35] 4.9 5.0 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 To append the average sepal length for each species, you would need three functions: mean() which can compute the average value of a data vector in lengths mean(sepals[[1, 2]]) ## [1] 5.006 map_dbl() which can apply mean() to each cell of lengths, which is a list-column. map_dbl(sepals$lengths, mean) ## [1] 5.006 5.936 6.588 mutate() which can add the results to a copy of the sepals table. sepals %&gt;% mutate(avg_length = map_dbl(lengths, mean)) ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## Species lengths avg_length ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 setosa &lt;dbl [50]&gt; 5.01 ## 2 versicolor &lt;dbl [50]&gt; 5.94 ## 3 virginica &lt;dbl [50]&gt; 6.59 mean() works with data vectors. map_dbl() works with list-columns. mutate() works with tables. Together they create the table you want. 4.18 Join data sets You want to Solution Discussion 4.19 Filter one data set against another You want to Solution Discussion To make the example easier to inspect, I made mtcars a tibble and removed the wt, qsec, vs, am, gear and carb columns before running this example.↩ mtcars$mpg is R syntax for the mpg column of the mtcars data frame.↩ I made this data frame with the code sepals &lt;- iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise(lengths = list(Sepal.Length))↩ "]
