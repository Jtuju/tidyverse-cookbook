# The Tidyverse Cookbook

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio-education/tidyverse-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio-education/tidyverse-cookbook)

This is the development website for __The Tidyverse Cookbook__, a collection of user contributed Tidyverse code recipes. 

* Read the online version of the book [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/).
* Request a recipe [here](https://github.com/rstudio-education/tidyverse-cookbook/issues).

The book is in very early stages of development, which means that we are hard at work making the initial coverage, quality, and taxonomy as good as possible! We hope to one soon open the book to the community, so that anyone can submit a recipe in the form of a pull request. Until then, if you see this message in the README **please refrain from submitting pull requests.**
