# What is the tidyverse? {-}

Each of the recipes in this book relies on R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of packages, functions, and _ideas_. You do not need to know which ideas are in the tidyverse to use tidyverse functions, just as you do not need to know which ingredients are in a cake mix to make a cake. But understanding the tidyverse will help you see the best practices embedded in each recipe. This will make it easier for you to adapt the recipes to your own work.

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science. Tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, so when you learn how to use one tidyverse package, you learn a lot about how to use the others.

Tidyverse packages are also: 

* optimised to run fast, relying on C++ under the hood
* maintained by a paid staff of talented developers
* unusually well documented, see [tidyverse.org](tidyverse.org) and [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as examples.

Install the complete set of tidyverse packages with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Tidy data {#tidy-data}

Each package in the tidyverse is designed to use and return **tidy data** whenever appropriate. Tidy data is tabular data organized so that:

1. Each column contains a single variable
1. Each row contains a single observation

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy-data.png")
```

In practice, tidy data in R appears as data frames or tibbles. A **tibble** is an enhanced version of a data frame that is easier to view at the command line. R treats tibbles like data frames in almost every other respect, because tibbles are a subclass of data frame.

Tidy tibbles act as a common data structure that tidyverse functions use to talk to each other. Tidy data has other advantages as well. Tidy data aligns with R's native data structure, the data frame; and tidy data is easy to use with R's fast, built in vectorized operations. You can think of tidy data as the data format optimized for R.

### Tidy tools

Each package in the tidyverse also provides **tidy tools**. Tidy tools are R functions that:

1. Accept and return the same type of data structure (as input and output)
1. Focus on one task per function
1. Can be combined with other functions to perform multi-step operations (using the pipe operator, `%>%`)

Tidy tools ensure that tidyverse packages are easy for _you_ to use. If tidy data is the data format optimised for R, tidy tools are the function format optimised for R users. 

```{block2, type = "rmdtip"}
If you'd like to develop a deeper understanding of the tidyverse, I encourage you to read [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), or to work through the [free tutorials on RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers).
